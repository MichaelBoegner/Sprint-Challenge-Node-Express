## What is Middleware?
- Middleware is an interface between the client and the server that allows us to more precisely manage the inputs of the client as well as the outputs of the server. 

## What is a Resource?
- Not sure. Maybe you meant response? Which would be the portion of the endpoint that is delivered back to the client in response to their request and the server's handling of said request. 

## What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
- A status code and an error message if applicable. 

## How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
- By using routers and middleware files. 

## What is express.json() and why do we need it?
